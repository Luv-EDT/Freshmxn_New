# Freshmxn — Day 5 Handover (running log)

**Written for:** the owner's local Claude Code session, which picks this work up after a `git pull`.
**Where this work happened:** a Claude Code **cloud** session (the owner was out of local usage).
It works on branch **`claude/peaceful-bohr-rkxau6`** — locally run
`git fetch origin && git checkout claude/peaceful-bohr-rkxau6` to continue from here.
**Updated:** with every commit, newest section at the bottom of §3.

Read `05_Day4_Handover.md` first — everything there still holds. This document covers Day 5 only.

## 1. The plan being executed

The owner's **local Day 5 plan** is the source of truth (Stage 1 functionality → Stage 2 purely
presentational design pass → Stage 3 deploy + E2E, with ⏸ STOP checkpoints). Settled with the owner
in that plan, not to be re-asked: puppeteer-core screenshots · `/` renders Landing when logged out
and the dashboard when logged in (`RootRoute`, `ProtectedRoute` untouched) · mentors self-register
and land as `pending_review` · Claude prepares deploys, the owner drives dashboards.

**Changes agreed in the cloud session (2026-09-24):**

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| **Deploy moved to the front (Stage 0)** | Render auto-deploys the branch on every push, so the owner reviews Stages 1–2 live on a laptop instead of from screenshots alone |
| **Free Render plan, workers inside the web process** | Render has no free background workers. See §2 |
| **Custom domain in two phases** | `beta.freshmxn.com` now (CNAME only, current Hostinger site untouched); `www` + apex at go-live. See `DEPLOY.md` |
| ⏸ STOPs kept | At each: push, the owner checks the live URL, Claude sends 360 px + 1280 px screenshots |
| `shoot.js` reads `CHROME_PATH` | Same script works in the cloud (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`) and locally (the cached `C:\Users\DELL\.cache\puppeteer` Chrome) |

"Commit everything to git first" from the local plan was already done (`269dfa5`).

## 2. Workers on the free plan — what was verified, and how

### The existing pipeline (unchanged)
Submit → `submissionsRouter.js:378` enqueues `score_profile` and returns instantly → the
**score_profile** worker grades the five open items (stored on the submission, so retries never
re-bill), scores, saves the profile, and enqueues `generate_report` → the **generate_report** worker
matches, recommends, composes, saves, marks `progress.report` → `ReportPage.js:174` polls every
5 s. Five attempts with exponential backoff; `addOnce` stops double-taps.

### What changed
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `Backend/workers/queueHelpers.js` | New `idleTimings()` → `{ drainDelay: 60, stalledInterval: 120000 }`, env-tunable via `WORKER_DRAIN_DELAY_S` / `WORKER_STALLED_INTERVAL_MS` |
| `scoreProfileWorker.js`, `generateReportWorker.js` | `...idleTimings()` in the `new Worker(...)` options; `start()` now `return worker` |
| `Backend/server.js` | After `listen()`: if `RUN_WORKERS_IN_WEB === "true"`, start both workers in-process. `SIGTERM` → `worker.close()` on both, then exit |

Nothing in `scoring/`, `matching/`, payments or any route changed. Locally, leave
`RUN_WORKERS_IN_WEB` unset and keep using `npm run worker:score` / `worker:report` as before.

### Verified — not assumed
- **BullMQ 6.3.8 source** (`worker.js` `getBlockTimeout()`): with no delayed jobs the idle block is
  `max(drainDelay, minimumBlockTimeout)` — **not** clipped to the 10 s `maximumBlockTimeout`, which
  only applies while a retry is in the delayed set. The backend's watchdog recovers hung blocks.
- **Pickup latency, real Redis:** worker idling in a 60 s block, job added → picked up in **5 ms**.
  Raising `drainDelay` does not delay jobs.
- **Idle traffic, Redis MONITOR on one idle worker:** per 60 s loop the client sends 1 `EVALSHA`
  (moveToActive) + 1 `BZPOPMIN`; plus 1 `EVALSHA` stalled sweep per 120 s → **~2.5 requests/min per
  worker ≈ 108k/month, ~216k/month for both** (BullMQ defaults: ~26/min per worker ≈ 2.2M/month for
  both). ⚠ `INFO commandstats` reports ~4× more because it also counts the commands executed *inside*
  the Lua scripts — confirm against Upstash's own usage graph after a day live. If high, raise
  `WORKER_DRAIN_DELAY_S` (env only).
- **Boot test:** `server.js` with `RUN_WORKERS_IN_WEB=true` against a local Redis — `GET /` 200,
  `GET /report` (SPA refresh) 200, both workers `listening`, 5 Redis connections, clean exit on
  `SIGTERM`.
- **Fixtures:** 22/22 · 51/51 · 99/99 before and after.
- **Redeploy mid-job:** lock expires, the next instance's stalled sweep requeues it within ~2 sweeps
  (~4 min) — safe because both jobs are retryable end to end.

### Deploy findings fixed along the way
- **Both `package-lock.json` files were out of sync** with `package.json` — `npm ci` (what Render
  runs) failed on missing `gcp-metadata`, `google-logging-utils` (Backend) and `yaml` (Frontend).
  Repaired with `npm install`: additive entries only, no installed version changed.
- **`RESEND_API_KEY` is effectively required at boot** — `userRouter.js:17` constructs `new Resend()`
  at require time and throws without a key, despite `server.js` treating email as non-fatal.
  Pre-existing; not changed (out of scope). Marked **required** in `DEPLOY.md`.
- Build runs with `CI=false` (Day 4 §6: `CI=true` promotes `Interest/` warnings to errors) and
  `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` (memory + no source in the browser). Verified: build passes, 0 `.map`
  files, 440 kB main bundle.
- `Frontend/public/index.html` has `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` — **preview
  only, remove at go-live** (DEPLOY.md Phase B step 5).
- New API route prefixes must not equal a page's URL prefix (e.g. API `/mentors` vs page
  `/mentor/…`): the SPA fallback is registered after the routers, so a collision 404s on refresh.

## 3. Log

### Stage 0 — deploy prep ✅ code done, owner dashboard steps pending
- `render.yaml` — one free web service, Singapore region, autoDeploy from this branch; paid-worker
  layout included commented out.
- `DEPLOY.md` — the owner's click-by-click guide: Atlas, Upstash, Render blueprint + env table,
  Google OAuth, admin seed (from the laptop — free plan has no Shell), smoke test, UptimeRobot,
  and the two-phase freshmxn.com domain move.
- Worker changes, lockfile repair and `noindex` as above.

**Next:** owner runs `DEPLOY.md` Steps 1–7 and sends back the Render URL / any red logs → then
Stage 1 (public site + mentor tier).

---

## 4. Open items carried forward
- Everything in Day 4 §5 (owner gates) still stands.
- Price mismatch in the content docs: `mentor_waitlist_page.md` says ₹6,500, `00_Master_Plan` says
  ₹7,000 — the pages will read `GET /payments/getPricing`, so the server's number wins; the copy doc
  should be corrected.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` crash-at-boot (§2) — a one-line lazy construction would fix it; owner's call.
